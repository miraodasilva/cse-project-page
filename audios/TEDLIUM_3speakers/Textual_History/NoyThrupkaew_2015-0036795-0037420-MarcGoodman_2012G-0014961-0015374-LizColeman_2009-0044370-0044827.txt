[unk] ten years ago i went through a little bit of a hard time
so i decided to go see a therapist i had been seeing her for a few months when she looked at me one day and said who actually raised you until you were three
[unk] i don't think that's actually the case because if it were we'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this it
sounded like the setup to a joke [unk] but i knew she was serious [unk]
because when i first started seeing her i was trying to be the funniest person in the room [unk] and i would try and crack these jokes but she caught on to me really quickly [unk]
and whenever i tried to make a joke she would look at me and say
that is actually really sad [unk]
so i knew i had to be serious [unk] and i asked my parents who had actually raised me until i was three [unk] and to my surprise they said
my primary caregiver had been a distant relative of the family [unk] i had called her my auntie [unk] i remember my auntie so
[unk] clearly it felt like she had been part of my life when i was much older [unk]
i remember the thick straight hair and how it would come around me like a curtain when she bent to pick me up
her soft southern thai accent [unk] the way i would cling to her even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom or get something to eat
i loved her but [ with ] the ferocity that a child has sometimes before she understands that love
[unk] also requires letting go [unk]
but my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie is also one of my first memories of life at all [unk]
i remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family [unk]
i remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop as i did every single time it happened for things as minor as wanting to go out with her
[unk] friends or being a little late [unk]
i became so hysterical over her treatment that eventually she was just beaten behind closed doors
things got so bad for her that eventually she ran away [unk]
as an adult i learned later that she had been just nineteen when she was brought over from thailand to the states to care for me on a tourist visa
[unk] she wound up working in illinois for a time before eventually returning to thailand which is where i ran into her again at a political rally in bangkok [unk]
i clung to her again as i had when i was a child [unk] and i let go and then i promised that i would call [unk]
i never did [unk] though [unk] because i was afraid if i said everything that she meant to me
that i owed perhaps the best parts of who i became to her care
and that the words i'm sorry were like a thimble to bail out all the guilt and shame and rage i felt
over everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had
i thought if i said those words to her i would never stop crying again
[unk] had saved me and i had not saved her [unk]
i'm a journalist and i've been writing and researching human trafficking for the past eight years or so [unk]
and even so i never put together this personal story with my professional life until pretty
[unk] i think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes most of our understanding about human trafficking [unk]
because human trafficking is far more prevalent complex and close to home than most of us realize [unk]
i spent time in jails and brothels [unk] interviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement ngo workers [unk] and when i think about what we've done about human trafficking
[unk] partly because we don't even talk about the problem right at all
when i say human trafficking most of you probably don't think about someone like my auntie
you probably think about a young girl or woman who's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp [unk]
that is real suffering [unk] and that is a real story that story makes me angry for far more than just the reality of that situation
as a journalist i really care about how we relate to each other through language and the way we tell that story with all the gory violent detail the salacious aspects
i call that look at her scars journalism
we use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl that story lets us off the hook
it takes away all the societal context that we might be indicted for for the structural inequality or the poverty or the barriers to migration [unk]
we let ourselves think that human trafficking is only about forced prostitution [unk]
when in reality human trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives
let me show you what i mean forced prostitution accounts for
[unk] human trafficking [unk]
ten percent is in state imposed forced labor
but a whopping sixty eight percent is for the purpose of creating the goods and delivering the services that most of us rely on every day
in sectors like agricultural work domestic work and construction [unk]
that is food and care and shelter
and somehow these most essential
[unk] workers are also among the world's most underpaid and exploited today [unk]
human trafficking is the use of force [unk] fraud or coercion to compel another person's labor

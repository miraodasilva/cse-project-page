[unk] a confession to make [unk]
i'm a business professor whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead
but recently i've discovered that what many of us think of as great leadership does not work when it comes to leading innovation [unk]
[unk] i'm an ethnographer i use the methods of anthropology to understand the questions in which i'm interested [unk] so along with [unk]
i spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation
we studied sixteen men and women [unk] located in seven countries across the globe working in twelve different industries
in total we spent hundreds of hours on the ground
[unk] watching these leaders in action [unk] we ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did
the bottom line if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again [unk] we must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership
leading innovation is not about creating a vision [unk] and inspiring others to execute it but
what do we
[unk] innovation is anything that is both new and useful
it can be a product or service it can be a process or a way of organizing [unk] it can be incremental or it can be breakthrough [unk] we have a pretty inclusive definition
how many of you recognize this man put your hands up
keep your hands up if you know who this is
[unk] from your show of hands it looks like many of you have seen a pixar movie but very few of you recognized ed catmull
the founder and ceo of pixar one of the companies i had the privilege of studying
my first visit to pixar was in two thousand and five when they were working on ratatouille that provocative movie about a rat
[unk] movies are really mainstream today [unk] but it took ed and his colleagues nearly twenty years to create the first
[unk] movie in the twenty years hence they've produced fourteen movies [unk] i was recently at pixar and i'm here to tell you that number fifteen is sure to be a winner
[unk] when many of us think about innovation though we think about an einstein having an' aha
[unk] but we all know that's a myth innovation is not about solo genius [unk] it's about collective genius
let's think for a minute about what it takes to make a pixar movie
no solo genius [unk] no flash of inspiration produces one of those movies
on the contrary it takes about two hundred and fifty people four to five years to make one of those
[unk] to help us understand the process an individual in the studio drew a version of this picture
he did so reluctantly [unk] because it suggested that the process was a neat series of steps done by discrete groups
even with all those arrows he thought it failed to really tell you just how iterative interrelated and frankly messy their process was
throughout the making of a movie at pixar [unk] the story evolves
[unk] so think about it [unk] some shots go through quickly [unk]

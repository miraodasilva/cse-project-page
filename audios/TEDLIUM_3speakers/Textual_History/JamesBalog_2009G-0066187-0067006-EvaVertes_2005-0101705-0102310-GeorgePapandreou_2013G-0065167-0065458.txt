[unk] most of the time art and science stare at each other across a gulf of mutual incomprehension [unk] there is great confusion
when the two look at each other art of course
[unk] looks at the world through
the psyche [unk] the emotions the unconscious at times and of course the aesthetic science
tends to look at the world through the rational [unk] the quantitative things that can be measured and described but it gives art a terrific context of understanding [unk]
in the extreme ice survey we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of
human understanding together to merging the art and science
to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity's relationship with nature better
specifically [unk] i as a person who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life
am firmly of the belief that photography [unk] video film have tremendous powers for helping us understand and shape
the way we think about nature and about ourselves
[unk] in relationship to nature in this project we're specifically interested of course in ice [unk]
i'm fascinated by the beauty of it the mutability of it the malleability of it and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself these first images are from greenland
but ice has another meaning ice is the
canary in the global coal mine
[unk] it's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action
climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of is it raining more or is it raining less is it getting hotter or is it getting colder
[unk] what do the computer models say about this that and the other thing
all of that strip
[unk] in the world of the arctic and alpine environments where the ice is it's real and it's present [unk] the changes are happening they're very visible they're photographable they're measurable
ninety five percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking [unk]
that's outside antarctica [unk] ninety five percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing [unk]
there is no significant scientific dispute about that
been observed [unk] it's measured [unk] it's bomb proof information and the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that science is not arguing about that
in these images we see ice from enormous glaciers ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old breaking up into chunks and chunk by chunk by chunk iceberg by iceberg [unk] turning into global sea
[unk] level rise [unk] so having seen all of this in the course of a 30 year career [unk]
i was still a skeptic about climate change until about ten years ago because i thought
the story of climate change was based on computer models i hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements
of what the [unk]
[unk] ancient climates were as recorded in the ice sheets as recorded in deep ocean sediments as recorded in lake sediments [unk] tree rings and a lot of other
ways of measuring temperature when i realized that climate change was real and it was not based on computer models i decided that one day i would i would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically and that led me to this
[unk] i was working on a national geographic assignment conventional single frame still photography and one crazy day i got the idea that i should
after that assignment was finished i got the idea that i should shoot
in time lapse photography that i should station a camera or two at a glacier and let it shoot every fifteen minutes or every hour or whatever
and watch the progression of the landscape over time well within about three
[unk] incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time lapse cameras into
[unk] cameras and the next six months of my life were the hardest
time in my career [unk] trying to design [unk] build and deploy out in the field these twenty five time lapse cameras
they are powered by the sun
[unk] solar panels power them power goes into a battery [unk] there is a custom made computer that tells the
[unk] camera when to fire and these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers and they look in on the glacier from permanent [unk] bedrock positions and they watch the evolution of the landscape
we just had a number of
cameras out on the greenland ice sheet we actually drilled holes into the ice way deep down below the thawing level and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so actually there's still a camera out there right now in any case
[unk] the cameras shoot roughly every hour [unk] some of them shoot every half hour every fifteen minutes every five minutes [unk] here's a time lapse of one of the time lapse units being made
i personally obsessed about every nut [unk] bolt and washer in these crazy things i spent half my life at our local hardware store during the months when we built these units originally [unk]
[unk] we're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere
our time lapse units are in alaska [unk] the rockies greenland and iceland [unk] and we have repeat photography positions that is places we just visit on an annual basis in british columbia the alps and bolivia [unk]
it's a big undertaking i stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team there's a lot of people working on this right now we've got thirty three cameras out this moment we
[unk] just had thirty three cameras shoot about half an hour ago
all across the northern hemisphere watching what's happened
and we've spent a lot of time in the field it's been a fantastic amount of work we've been out for two and a half years and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go
that's only half our job the other half of our job is to tell the story to the global
[unk] scientists have collected this kind of information
off and on over the years [unk] but a lot of it stays within the science community [unk] similarly
a lot of art projects stay in the art community and i feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like ted and like our relationship with the obama white house with the senate with john
[unk] to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well [unk] we've done films we've done books we have more coming we have a site on google earth
that google earth was was generous enough to give us [unk]
and so forth because we feel very much the need to tell this story because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now
now one bit of science before we get into the visuals if everybody in the developed world
understood this graph [unk] and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads there would be no further societal argument about climate change because
this is the story that counts everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion [unk]
key issues [unk] this is a four hundred thousand year record [unk] this exact same pattern is seen going back now almost a million years before our current time
several things are important number one temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go up and down basically in sync you can see that from the orange line and the blue line
nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to two hundred and eighty parts per million [unk] that's the natural cycle
goes up to two hundred and eighty and then drops for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here [unk] but two
[unk] is the peak right now if you look at the top right part of that graph [unk] we're at three hundred and eighty five parts per million [unk] we are way way outside the normal natural variability
earth is having a fever [unk] in the past hundred years the temperature of the earth has gone up
one point three degrees fahrenheit 75 degrees
[unk] it's going to keep going up because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere
at the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year [unk] it's been a remorseless [unk] steady increase we have to turn that around
that's the crux [unk] and someday i hope to emblazon that across times square in new york and a lot of other places but anyway
off to the world of ice we're now at the columbia glacier in alaska this is a view of what's called the calving face [unk] this is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months
you see the glacier flowing in from the right
dropping off into the sea camera shooting every hour [unk] if you look in the in the middle background you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo yo
that means that glacier's floating and it's unstable and you're about to see the consequences of that floating to give you
a little bit of a sense of scale [unk] that calving face in this picture
is about
[unk] three hundred and twenty five feet tall that's thirty two stories [unk] this is not a little cliff [unk] this is like a major office building in an urban center [unk]
the calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off [unk] but in fact it goes down below sea level
another couple thousand feet so there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep going down to bedrock if
if the glacier's grounded on bedrock and floating if it isn't here
what columbia's done this is in south central alaska [unk]
this was an aerial picture i did one day in june three years ago [unk] this is an aerial picture we did this year [unk]
that's the retreat
[unk] the main stem the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right
and
it's going very rapidly up that stem we're going to be up there in just a few more weeks [unk] and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile but if i
if i got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back i wouldn't be the least bit surprised now it's really hard to grasp the scale of
[unk] these places because as the glaciers one of the things is that places like alaska and greenland are huge they're not normal landscapes
but as the glaciers are are retreating [unk] they're also deflating like air is being let out of a balloon
and so there are features on this landscape there's a ridge right in the middle of the picture up above where that arrow comes in
that shows you that a little bit there's a marker line called the trim line
above our little red
[unk] illustration there this is something no self respecting photographer would ever do you put some cheesy illustration on your shot right and

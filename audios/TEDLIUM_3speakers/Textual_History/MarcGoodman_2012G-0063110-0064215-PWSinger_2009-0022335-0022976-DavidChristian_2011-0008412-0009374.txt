[unk] i study
the future of crime and terrorism [unk]
and frankly [unk] i'm afraid [unk] i'm afraid by what i see [unk] i sincerely
[unk] that we've been promised but you see [unk] i've spent a career in law enforcement
and that's informed my perspective on things i've been a street police officer an undercover investigator a counter terrorism strategist [unk] and i've worked in more than seventy countries around the world [unk]
i've had to see more than my fair share of violence
and the darker underbelly of society and
[unk]'s informed my opinions
my work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational they have taught me a lot [unk]
and i'd like to be able to share some of these observations with you
today i'm going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at the ones
[unk] that we love in the hands of the ted community these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world [unk]
but in the hands
of suicide bombers the future can look quite different i started observing
technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer in those days this was the height of technology
[unk] though you will all the drug dealers and gang members with whom i dealt had one of these long before any police officer i knew did
twenty years later criminals are still using mobile phones [unk]
but they're also building their own mobile phone networks like this one [unk] which has been deployed in all thirty one states of mexico by the narcos [unk]
they have a national encrypted radio communications system
think about that think about the innovation that went into that think about the infrastructure to build it
and then think about this [unk] why can't i get a cell phone signal in san francisco
how is this possible it makes no sense
we consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do
[unk] technology has made our world increasingly open and for the most part that's great but all of this openness may have unintended consequences [unk]
consider the two thousand and eight terrorist attack on mumbai [unk]
the men that carried that attack out were armed
explosives and hand grenades [unk] they threw these hand grenades at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes
[unk] and waited to catch trains on their way home from work [unk]
but heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations guns and bombs are nothing new
what was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims
and slaughter them they were armed with mobile phones
[unk] they had blackberries [unk] they had access to satellite imagery [unk] they had satellite phones [unk] and they even had night vision goggles [unk]
but perhaps their greatest innovation was this [unk]
we've all seen pictures like this on television and in the news
this is an operations center and the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in pakistan where they monitored the bbc al jazeera
[unk] jazeera [unk] cnn and indian local stations they also monitored the internet and social media
to monitor the progress of their attacks and how many people they had killed [unk]
they did all of this in real time
the innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over
[unk] the police
and over the government
what did they do with this [unk] they used it to great effect
at one point during the 60 hour siege the terrorists were going room to room trying to find additional victims
they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed and they
[unk] are you and what are you doing here and the man replied i'm just an innocent schoolteacher of course the terrorists knew
that no indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the taj [unk]
they picked up his identification and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room
where the terrorist war room googled him and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said
your hostage is he heavyset
[unk] is he bald in front [unk]
does he wear glasses
yes yes yes came the answers [unk]
the op center had found him and they had a match he was not a schoolteacher he was the second wealthiest businessman in india [unk]
and after discovering this information the terrorist war room
[unk] all worry about our privacy settings on facebook
but the fact of the matter is our openness can be used against us
terrorists are doing this a search engine
can determine who shall live and who shall die this is the world that we live in
during the mumbai siege terrorists were so dependent on technology that several witnesses reported that as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand
they were checking their mobile phone messages in the very other hand
in the end [unk] three hundred people were gravely wounded and over one hundred and
[unk] women and children lost their lives that day [unk]
think about what happened [unk] during this 60 hour siege on mumbai [unk] ten
men armed not just with weapons [unk] but with technology were able to bring a city of twenty million people
to a standstill [unk] ten people brought twenty million people to a standstill [unk] and this traveled around the world this
[unk] this is what radicals can do with openness
this was done nearly four years ago [unk] what could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have
what will they do tomorrow [unk]
the ability of one to affect many is scaling exponentially [unk] and it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil
it's not just about terrorism though there's also been a big paradigm shift in crime [unk] you see [unk]
you can now commit more crime as well in the old days it was a knife and a gun then criminals moved to robbing trains you could rob two hundred people on a train a great innovation
moving forward the internet allowed things to scale even more in fact many of you will remember the recent sony playstation hack
[unk] in that incident over one hundred million people were robbed [unk]
think about that
when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob one hundred million
of course it's not just about stealing things there are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit many of you will remember this super cute
[unk] video from the last ted
[unk] but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute [unk]
they don't all have drumsticks some can be armed with hd cameras and do countersurveillance on protesters [unk]
or as in this little bit of movie magic [unk] quadcopters can be loaded
with firearms
and automatic weapons
[unk] are cute when they play music to you when they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you a little bit less so
of course [unk] criminals and terrorists weren't the first to give guns to robots we know where that started but they're adapting quickly [unk] recently the fbi arrested an al qaeda affiliate in the united states who was planning on using
[unk] drone aircraft to fly c4 explosives into government buildings in the united states by the way these travel at over six hundred miles an hour [unk]
every time a new technology is being introduced criminals are there to exploit it we've all seen 3d printers we know with them that you can print in many materials ranging from plastic to chocolate to metal and
[unk] with great precision i actually was able to make this just the other day a very cute little ducky [unk]
but i wonder to myself for those people that strap
bombs to their chests
and blow themselves up how might they use
[unk] if you can print in metal you can print one of these and in fact
you can also print one of these too
the uk i know has some very strict firearms
[unk] you needn't bring the gun into the uk anymore [unk] you just bring the 3d printer and print the gun while you're here and of course the magazines for your bullets [unk]
but as these get bigger in the future [unk] what other items will you be able to print the technologies are allowing bigger printers [unk]
as we move forward we'll see new technologies also like the internet of things [unk] every day we're connecting more and more of our lives
[unk] to the internet which means that the internet of things will soon be

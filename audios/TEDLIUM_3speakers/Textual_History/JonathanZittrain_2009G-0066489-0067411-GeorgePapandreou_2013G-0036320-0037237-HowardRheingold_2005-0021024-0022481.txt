[unk] my name is jonathan zittrain [unk] and in my recent work i've been a bit of a pessimist so i thought this morning i would try to be the optimist and give reason to hope for the future of the internet by drawing upon its present
now it may seem like there
[unk] is less hope today than there was before people are less kind there is less trust around i don't know as a
simple example we could run a test here how many people have ever hitchhiked [unk]
i know [unk] how many people have hitchhiked within the past ten years
[unk] right [unk] so what has changed it's not better public transportation [unk]
so that's one reason to think that we might be declensionists going in the wrong direction
but i want to give you three examples to try to say that the trend line is in fact in the other direction [unk] and it's the internet helping it along [unk]
so example number one the internet
[unk] itself these are three of the founders of the internet [unk] they were actually high school classmates together at the same high school in suburban los angles in the [unk]
you might have had a french club or a debate club they had a let's build a global network club and it worked out very well [unk] they are pictured
[unk] anniversary newsweek retrospective on the internet and as you can tell they are basically goof balls [unk]
they had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network
the limitation was that they didn't have any money no particular amount of capital to invest
[unk] of the sort that for a physical network you might need for trucks and people and a hub to move packages around overnight they had none of that
but they had an amazing freedom which was they didn't have to make any money from it
the internet has no business plan never did no ceo
no firm responsible singly for building it [unk]
[unk] it's folks getting together to do something for fun rather than because they were told to or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it
that ethos led to a network architecture a structure that was unlike other digital networks then or since so unusual in fact that it was said that it's not clear the internet could
[unk] was known to say you couldn't possibly build a corporate network using internet protocol
and even some internet engineers today say the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out
that's why the mascot of internet engineering if it had one is said to be the bumblebee because the
[unk] ratio of the bumblebee is far too large for it to be able to fly [unk] and yet [unk] mysteriously [unk] somehow the bee flies [unk]
i'm pleased to say that thanks to massive government funding about three years ago we finally figured out how bees fly it
very complicated but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly
so what is this bizarre
[unk] architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual [unk] well to move data around from one place to another again it's not like a package courier [unk] it's more like a mosh pit
imagine you being part of a network where you're maybe at a sporting event and you're sitting in rows like this and somebody asks for a beer [unk]
and it gets handed at the aisle and
[unk] your neighborly duty is to pass the beer along at risk to your own trousers
to get it to the destination [unk]
no one pays you to do this it's just part of your neighborly duty
and in a way that's exactly how packets move around the internet sometimes in as many as twenty five or thirty
[unk] with the intervening entities that are passing the data around having no particular contractual or legal obligation to the original sender or to the receiver
[unk] now of course in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination
[unk] you need a lot of trust [unk] but it's not like i'm trying to get to pensacola please so
the internet needs addressing and directions [unk] it turns out there is no one overall map of the internet
[unk] instead again it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater [unk] but we can only see amidst the fog the people immediately around us [unk]
so what do we do to figure out who is where
we turn to the person on the right [unk] and we tell that person what we see on our left [unk] and vice versa [unk] and they can lather rinse repeat and before you
[unk] you have a general sense of where everything is this is how internet addressing and routing actually work
this is a system that relies on kindness and trust
which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable
in rare but striking instances a single lie told by just one entity in this honeycomb
can lead to real trouble so for
[unk] last year the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent
citizens of pakistan from seeing youtube there was a video there that the government did not like and they wanted to make sure it was blocked this is a common occurrence governments everywhere are often trying to block and filter and censor content on the internet [unk]
well this one isp in pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way
[unk] it advertised the way that you might be asked if you were part of the internet to declare what you see near you it advertised that near it [unk] in fact it had suddenly awakened to find that it was youtube
that's right it said i am youtube which meant that packets of data from
from subscribers going to youtube stopped at the isp since they thought they were already there and the isp threw them away unopened because the point was to block it [unk]
but it didn't stop there you see that
announcement went one click out which got reverberated one click out and it turns out that as you look at the postmortem of this event [unk] you have at one moment perfectly working youtube [unk]
[unk] at moment number two [unk] you have the fake announcement go out and within two minutes
it reverberates around and youtube is blocked everywhere in the world if you were sitting in oxford england trying to get to youtube your packets were going to pakistan and they weren't coming back
now just think about that one of the most popular websites in the world [unk] run by the most powerful company in the world [unk] and there was nothing
that youtube or google
[unk] were particularly privileged to do about it [unk] and yet somehow within about two hours the problem was fixed
how did this happen [unk]
well for a big clue we turn to nanog [unk] the north american network operators group
a group of people who on a beautiful day outside enter into a windowless room at their terminals
[unk] reading
email and messages in
fixed proportion font like this
and they talk about networks and some of them are mid level employees at internet service providers around the world [unk] and here is the message where one of them says looks like we've got a live one we [unk]
[unk] have a hijacking of youtube this is not a drill it's not just the cluelessness of youtube engineers i promise
and they came together to help find the problem and fix it so it
kind of like if your house catches on fire
the bad news is there is no fire brigade
the good news is random people apparate from nowhere put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise
i was trying to think of the right model to describe
this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers
you know it's just like the hail goes out and people are ready to help [unk]
and it turns out this model is everywhere once you start looking for it [unk]
example number two
[unk] man named jimbo came up to you in two thousand and one and said i've got a great idea we start with seven articles that anybody can edit anything at any time and we'll get a great encyclopedia eh
right [unk] dumbest idea ever
in fact wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid
that even jimbo never had it [unk] jimbo's idea was for nupedia it was going to be totally traditional he would pay people money because he was
[unk] feeling like a good guy
and the money would go to the people and they would write the articles [unk]
the wiki was introduced so others could make suggestions on edits as almost an afterthought a back room [unk]
and then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project and today wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now
[unk] i am not making this up
i have a theory i can explain later [unk] suffice it to say for now that i prefer my wikipedia stir fried with pimentos
laughter but now wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work how does it really work [unk] it turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless
[unk] metaphorically speaking [unk] and there are a bunch of people who on a sunny day would rather be inside
and monitoring this the administrator's notice board itself a wiki page that anyone can edit [unk]
and you just bring your problems to the page it's reminiscent of the description of history as one damn thing after another
right number one tendentious editing by user andyvphil
[unk] andyvphil if you're here today [unk] i'm not taking sides anon attacking me for reverting here is my favorite a long story

[unk] this will not be a speech like any one i have ever given i will talk to you today about
the failure of leadership in global politics
[unk] and in our globalizing economy [unk] and i won't provide some
[unk] solutions [unk] but i will in the end urge you
to rethink actually take risks and get involved in what i see as a global evolution
of democracy failure of leadership what is the failure of leadership today
and why is our democracy not working [unk] well [unk] i believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken
you out of the process [unk] so let me from my personal experiences give you
an insight [unk] so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going
a blind alley [unk] let's start from the beginning let's start from
democracy [unk] well if you go back to the ancient greeks [unk] it was a revelation [unk] a discovery that
we had the potential together [unk] to be masters of our
[unk] to be able to examine to learn to imagine and then to design a better life [unk] and democracy was the
political innovation
which protected this freedom because we were liberated from fear
so that our minds in fact whether they be despots or dogmas could be the protagonists
[unk] democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power whether it was of tyrants
or of high priests
their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth [unk] well i first began to understand this when i was fourteen years old
i used to to try to avoid homework
sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly you see then greece was
under control of a very powerful
establishment which was strangling the country [unk] and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine greece to
imagine a greece where freedom reigned and where maybe the people the citizens could actually rule
[unk] i used to join him in many of the campaigns and you can see me here next to him i'm the younger one there to the side
you may not recognize me because i used to part my hair differently there
elections were coming
things were going well in the campaign the house was electric we really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in greece
[unk] one night
military trucks drive up to our house
soldiers storm the door they find me up on the top terrace a
sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun puts it to my head and says tell me where your father is or i will kill you
[unk] and was summarily
taken to prison [unk] well [unk] we survived [unk] but democracy did not seven brutal years of dictatorship
which we spent in exile now
today our democracies are again facing a moment of truth [unk] let me tell you a story [unk] sunday evening
[unk] april two thousand and ten i'm sitting with my counterparts in the european union i had just been elected prime minister [unk]
but i had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth
that our deficit was not six percent as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections
by the previous government but actually fifteen point six percent
[unk] but the deficit was only
the symptom of much deeper problems that greece was facing and
i had been elected on a mandate [unk] a mission actually to tackle these problems whether it was
lack of transparency and accountability in governance or whether it was a clientelistic state offering favors to
the powerful tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax
[unk] evasion system
politics and media captured by special interests [unk]
but despite our electoral mandate [unk] the markets mistrusted us
our borrowing costs were skyrocketing and we were facing possible default so i went to brussels on a mission
[unk] to make the case
for a united european response one that would calm the markets and give us the time
to make the necessary reforms but time we didn't get
picture yourselves around the table in brussels [unk]
negotiations are difficult the tensions are high progress is slow and then ten minutes to two a prime minister shouts out we have to
[unk] these are important decisions let's deliberate a little bit longer another prime minister comes in and says
no we have to have an agreement now
because in ten minutes the markets are opening up in japan and there will be havoc in the global economy
we quickly came to a decision in those ten minutes this time it was not the military but
the markets that put a gun to our collective heads
what followed were the most difficult decisions in my life [unk] painful to me [unk]
painful to my countrymen [unk] imposing cuts austerity [unk] often on those not to blame for the crisis
with these sacrifices greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided
[unk] a collapse greece [unk] yes triggered the euro crisis [unk] and some people blame me for pulling the trigger [unk]
but i think today that most would agree
that greece was only a symptom
of much deeper
structural problems in the eurozone [unk] vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system [unk] vulnerabilities of our democracies
[unk] trapped by systems too big to fail or more accurately too big to control
our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws evade taxes [unk] evade environmental or labor standards
our democracies are undermined
by the growing inequality and the growing concentration of power and wealth
corruption [unk] the speed of the markets or simply the fact that
we sometimes fear an impending disaster have constrained our democracies and they have constrained our capacity to imagine and actually use the potential [unk] your potential
in finding solutions
[unk] a preview of what is in store for us all i overly optimistically had hoped that this crisis
was an opportunity for greece for europe for the world to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions [unk]
instead i had a very humbling experience
in brussels when we tried desperately again and again
to find common solutions i realized that not one not one of us
had ever dealt with a similar crisis [unk] but worse we were trapped by our collective ignorance we were led
by our fears and our fears led to a blind faith
in the orthodoxy of austerity [unk] instead of reaching out to the
common or the collective wisdom in our
[unk] societies [unk] investing in it to find more creative solutions we reverted to political posturing [unk]
and then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure
didn't bring an end to the crisis and of course that made it very easy
to look for a whipping boy for our collective european failure and of course
[unk] a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt
even more than austerity itself [unk] but let me warn you this is not just about greece this could be the pattern
that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex
[unk] problems whether it's climate change whether it's migration whether it's the financial system
that is abandoning our collective power to imagine our potential [unk] falling victims to our fears our stereotypes our dogmas [unk]
taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around
[unk] and doing so will only test the faith of our citizens of our peoples even more in the democratic process
it's no wonder that many political leaders and i don't exclude myself
have lost the trust
of our people [unk] when riot police have to protect parliaments [unk] a scene which is
increasingly common around the world then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies
[unk] that's why i called for a referendum to have the greek people own and decide
on the terms of the rescue package my european counterparts some of them at least said you can't do this there will be
havoc in the markets again i said we need to before we restore confidence in the markets we need to restore
confidence and trust amongst our people
since leaving office i have had time to reflect [unk]
we have weathered the storm in greece and in europe [unk]
but we remain challenged
if politics is the power to imagine and use our potential well then [unk] 60 percent youth unemployment in greece
and in other countries certainly is a lack of imagination if not a lack of compassion
[unk] far we've thrown economics at the problem actually mostly austerity [unk]
and certainly we could have designed alternatives [unk] a different strategy [unk] a green stimulus for green jobs or
mutualized debt eurobonds which would support countries in need from
market pressures these would have been much more viable alternatives [unk] yet i have come to believe that the problem is not so much one of economics as it is one
[unk] of democracy [unk] so let's try something else [unk] let's see how we can bring people back to the process [unk] let's throw democracy at the problem
again the ancient greeks with all their shortcomings [unk] believed in the wisdom of the crowd
at their best moments in people we trust democracy could not
work without the citizens
deliberating debating taking on public responsibilities for public affairs [unk]
average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to
decide on critical matters of the day [unk]
science [unk] theater research philosophy games of the mind and the body they were daily exercises actually they were an education for
[unk] for the potential for growing the potential of our citizens [unk] and those who shunned politics well they were
idiots you see in ancient greece in ancient athens that term originated there
idiot comes from the root idio oneself a
person who is self centered secluded [unk] excluded someone who doesn't participate or even examine
[unk] and participation took place in the agora the agora having two meanings both a marketplace
and a place where there was political deliberation
you see markets and politics then were one unified accessible transparent because they gave power to the people they serve the demos [unk]
democracy [unk]
[unk] above markets was the direct rule of the people today we have globalized the markets
but we have not globalized our democratic institutions [unk] so our politicians are limited
to local politics [unk] while our citizens even though they see a great potential are prey
to forces beyond their control so how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora how do we democratize globalization
[unk] and i'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the united nations or the g20 i'm talking about how do we secure the space the demos the platform of values
so that we can tap into
all of [unk] your potential well
this is exactly where i think europe fits in europe despite its recent failures is the world's most successful
[unk] cross border peace experiment so let's see if it can't be
an experiment
in global democracy [unk] a new kind of democracy [unk]
let's see if we can't design a european agora not simply for products and services but for our citizens where they can
work together deliberate learn from each other exchange between art and cultures where they can
come up
[unk] with creative solutions [unk] let's imagine that european citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a european president
or citizen juries
chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues
a european wide referendum where our citizens as the lawmakers vote on future treaties
and here's an idea
why not have the first truly european citizens by giving our immigrants not greek or german or
swedish citizenship but
a european citizenship [unk] and make sure we
actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in europe where our
[unk] common identity is
democracy where our education is
through participation and where participation builds trust
and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia europe of and by the people [unk] a europe
an experiment in deepening and widening democracy
beyond borders
now some might accuse me of being naive [unk] putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people [unk]
well after decades in politics [unk] i am also a pragmatist
believe me i have been i am part of today's political system [unk]
and i know things must change we
[unk] must revive politics as the power to imagine reimagine and redesign
for a better world [unk]
but i also know that this disruptive force of change won't be driven by the politics of today [unk] the revival of democratic politics
will come from
[unk] and i mean all of you [unk] everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas whether it's here in this room or just outside this room
or online or locally where everybody lives [unk] everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality
everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy [unk]

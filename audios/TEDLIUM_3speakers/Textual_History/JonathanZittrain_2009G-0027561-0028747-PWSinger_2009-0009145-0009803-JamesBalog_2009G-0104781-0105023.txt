[unk] my name is jonathan zittrain [unk] and in my recent work i've been a bit of a pessimist so i thought this morning i would try to be the optimist and give reason to hope for the future of the internet by drawing upon its present
now it may seem like there
[unk] is less hope today than there was before people are less kind there is less trust around i don't know as a
simple example we could run a test here how many people have ever hitchhiked [unk]
i know [unk] how many people have hitchhiked within the past ten years
[unk] right [unk] so what has changed it's not better public transportation [unk]
so that's one reason to think that we might be declensionists going in the wrong direction
but i want to give you three examples to try to say that the trend line is in fact in the other direction [unk] and it's the internet helping it along [unk]
so example number one the internet
[unk] itself these are three of the founders of the internet [unk] they were actually high school classmates together at the same high school in suburban los angles in the [unk]
you might have had a french club or a debate club they had a let's build a global network club and it worked out very well [unk] they are pictured
[unk] anniversary newsweek retrospective on the internet and as you can tell they are basically goof balls [unk]
they had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network
the limitation was that they didn't have any money no particular amount of capital to invest
[unk] of the sort that for a physical network you might need for trucks and people and a hub to move packages around overnight they had none of that
but they had an amazing freedom which was they didn't have to make any money from it
the internet has no business plan never did no ceo
no firm responsible singly for building it [unk]
[unk] it's folks getting together to do something for fun rather than because they were told to or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it
that ethos led to a network architecture a structure that was unlike other digital networks then or since so unusual in fact that it was said that it's not clear the internet could
[unk] was known to say you couldn't possibly build a corporate network using internet protocol
and even some internet engineers today say the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out
that's why the mascot of internet engineering if it had one is said to be the bumblebee because the
[unk] ratio of the bumblebee is far too large for it to be able to fly [unk] and yet [unk] mysteriously [unk] somehow the bee flies [unk]
i'm pleased to say that thanks to massive government funding about three years ago we finally figured out how bees fly it
very complicated but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly
so what is this bizarre
[unk] architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual [unk] well to move data around from one place to another again it's not like a package courier [unk] it's more like a mosh pit
imagine you being part of a network where you're maybe at a sporting event and you're sitting in rows like this and somebody asks for a beer [unk]
and it gets handed at the aisle and
[unk] your neighborly duty is to pass the beer along at risk to your own trousers
to get it to the destination [unk]
no one pays you to do this it's just part of your neighborly duty
and in a way that's exactly how packets move around the internet sometimes in as many as twenty five or thirty

[unk] college presidents are not the first people who come to mind
when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination so i thought i'd start by telling you how i got here [unk] the story begins in the late'
[unk] i was invited to meet with leading educators from the newly free eastern europe and russia
they were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities [unk] since education under the soviet union was essentially propaganda
serving the purposes of a state ideology [unk] they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations
if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women [unk] given this rare
[unk] opportunity to start fresh they chose liberal arts as the most compelling model because of its historic commitment to furthering its students' broadest intellectual and deepest ethical potential
having made that decision they came to the united states [unk] home of liberal arts education to talk with some of us most closely identified
[unk] with that kind of education they spoke with a passion an urgency an intellectual conviction
that for me was a voice i had not heard in decades a dream long forgotten
for in truth [unk] we had moved light years
from the passions that animated them [unk]
but for me
[unk] unlike them in my world [unk] the slate was not clean [unk] and what was written
on it was not encouraging in truth [unk] liberal arts education
no longer exists at least genuine liberal arts education in this country we have professionalized liberal arts to the point
where they no longer provide
the breadth of application and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement
that is their signature [unk] over the past century the expert has dethroned the educated generalist
to become the sole model of intellectual accomplishment expertise
has for sure had its moments [unk] but the price of its
[unk] dominance is enormous
subject matters are broken up into smaller and smaller pieces with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure [unk]
we have even managed to make the study of literature arcane
you may think you know what is going on in that jane austen novel that is until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism
the progression of today's college student is to jettison every interest except one
and within that one to continually narrow the focus learning more and more about less and less
this despite the evidence all around us of the interconnectedness of things [unk]
lest you think i exaggerate
here are the beginnings of the a b cs of anthropology
as one moves up the ladder values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion [unk]
questions such as what kind of a world are we making what kind of a world should we be making [unk] what kind of a world can we be making
[unk] treated with more and more skepticism [unk] and move off the table in so doing
the guardians of secular democracy in effect
yield the connection between education and values to fundamentalists who you can be sure
have no compunctions about using education to further their values the absolutes
of a theocracy [unk] meanwhile [unk] the values and voices of democracy are silent [unk]
either we have lost touch with those values or no better believe they need not or cannot be taught
this aversion to social values may seem at odds with the explosion of community service programs [unk] but despite the attention paid to
[unk] these efforts they remain emphatically extracurricular in effect
[unk] is treated as outside the realm of what purports to be serious thinking and adult purposes simply put
when the impulse is to change the world
[unk] the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness
than to create a sense of empowerment this brew
oversimplification of civic engagement
idealization of the expert fragmentation of knowledge
emphasis on technical mastery neutrality as a condition of academic integrity is toxic
when it comes to pursuing the vital
[unk] connections between education and the public good between intellectual integrity
and human freedom which were at the heart of the challenge
posed to and by
my european colleagues when the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge
were more than enough i can assure you to give one pause
what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable [unk]

[unk] language spoken by hungarians for which given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet
few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago but
there it is j napot [unk] pack i said
somebody here must surely know because despite the fact that there aren't that many hungarians to begin with and the further fact that so far as i know there's not a drop of hungarian blood in my veins at every critical juncture of my life
[unk] there has been a hungarian friend or mentor there beside me i even have dreams that take place in landscapes i recognize as the landscapes of hungarian films especially the early movies of miklos jancso so
how do i explain this mysterious affinity [unk] maybe it's because my native state of south carolina which is not much smaller than present day hungary [unk]
[unk] once imagined a future for itself as an independent country and as a consequence of that presumption my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army an experience [unk]
[unk] that has befallen many a hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history or maybe it's because when i was a teenager back in the' 50s my uncle henry having [unk]
[unk] denounced the ku klux klan and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard living under death threat took his wife and children to massachusetts for safety
and went back to south carolina to face down the klan alone that was a very hungarian thing to do as anyone will attest who remembers [unk]
and of course from time to time hungarians have invented their own equivalent of the klan well [unk] it seems to me
that this hungarian presence in my life is difficult to account for
but ultimately
i ascribe it to an admiration for people with a complex moral awareness with a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado [unk] it's not a typical mindset for most americans [unk]
but it is perforce typical of virtually all hungarians so j napot pack
[unk] i went back to south carolina after some fifteen years amid the alien corn at the tail end of the [unk]
[unk] the reckless condescension of that era thinking i would save my people
never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving i labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate south carolina
[unk] institution of higher learning called wofford college [unk] i knew nothing about wofford and even less about methodism [unk]
but i was reassured on the first day that i taught at wofford college to find among the auditors in my classroom [unk] a 90 year old hungarian
surrounded by a bevy of middle aged european women who seemed to function as an entourage of rhinemaidens his name was sandor teszler
[unk] he was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead
and whose grandchildren lived far away in appearance he resembled mahatma gandhi [unk] minus the loincloth plus orthopedic boots
he had been born in one thousand nine hundred and three in the provinces of the old austro hungarian empire in what later would become yugoslavia
he was ostracized as a child not because he was a jew his parents weren't very religious anyhow but because he had been born with two club feet
[unk] a condition which in those days required institutionalization
and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and eleven
he went to the commercial business high school as a young man in budapest
and there he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed a considerable success and after graduation when he went into textile engineering the success continued [unk] he built one plant after another he married
[unk] and had two sons he had friends in high places who assured him that he was of great value to the economy [unk]
once as he had left instructions to have done [unk] he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants
the night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks it was a hosiery mill and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock and was shoveling in mountains of socks mr teszler went down to the plant
[unk] and confronted the thief and said
but why do you steal from me if you need money you have only to ask
the night watchman seeing how things were going and waxing indignant said well we're going to call the police aren't we
but mr teszler answered no that will not be necessary [unk] he will not steal from us again well
maybe he was too
[unk] because he stayed where he was long after the nazi anschluss in austria
and even after the arrests and deportations began in budapest
he took the simple precaution of having cyanide capsules placed in lockets that could be worn about the necks of himself and his family [unk]
and then one day it happened [unk] he and his family were arrested and they were taken to a death house on the danube [unk] in those early days of the final
[unk] it was handcrafted
brutality people were beaten to death and their bodies tossed into the river [unk] but none who entered that death house had ever come out alive and in a twist
you would not believe in a steven spielberg film
the gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief who had stolen socks from mr teszler's hosiery mill [unk]
it was a brutal beating
[unk] midway through
that brutality one of mr teszler's sons andrew [unk] looked up and said is it time to take the capsule now papa
and the gauleiter who afterwards vanishes from this story leaned down
and whispered into mr teszler's ear no do not take the capsule
help is on the way and then resumed the beating but help help was on the way and shortly afterwards a car arrived from the swiss embassy they were spirited to safety they were reclassified as yugoslav
[unk] citizens and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers for the duration of the war surviving burnings and bombings and at the end of the war arrest by the soviets [unk]
probably mr teszler had gotten some money into swiss bank accounts
because he managed to take his family first to great britain then to long island and then to the center of the textile industry in the american south
which as chance would have it was spartanburg south carolina
[unk] the location of wofford college and there mr teszler
began all over again
and once again achieved immense success especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double knit and then
then in the late 1950s in the aftermath of brown v board of education when the klan was resurgent all over the south
i have heard this talk before and he called his top assistant to him
and asked where would you say in this region [unk]
racism is most virulent well [unk] i don't rightly know mr teszler [unk] i reckon that would be kings mountain good
buy us some land in kings mountain and announce we are going to build a major plant there
the man did as he was told and shortly afterwards
[unk] teszler received a visit from the white mayor of kings mountain now you should know that at that time the textile industry in the south was notoriously segregated
the white mayor visited mr teszler and said mr teszler [unk] i trust youre going to be hiring a lot of white workers
mr teszler told him you bring me the best workers that you can
[unk] and if they are good enough i will hire them
he also received a visit from the leader of the black community a minister who said mr teszler i sure hope you're going to hire some black workers for this new plant of yours he got the same answer
you bring the best workers that you can find [unk] and if they are good enough [unk]
i will hire them
as it happens the black minister did his job better than the white mayor but that's neither here or there mr teszler hired sixteen men [unk]
[unk] be his seed group his future foremen
he had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of kings mountain
and for two months these sixteen men would live and work together mastering the new process
he gathered them together after an initial tour of that facility and he asked if there were any questions [unk] there was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet [unk] and then one of the white workers stepped forward and said
only one place to eat there's only one bathroom there's only one water fountain is this plant going to be integrated or what
mr teszler said you are being paid twice the wages of any other textile workers in this region and this is how we do business
do you have any other questions no i reckon i don't
and two months later
when the main plant opened and hundreds of new workers white and
[unk] black poured in to see the facility for the first time they were met by the sixteen foremen white and black standing shoulder to shoulder [unk]
they toured the facility and were asked if there were any questions and inevitably the same question arose is this plant integrated or what
and one of the white foremen stepped forward and said you are being paid twice the wages of any other workers in this industry in this region
and this is how we do business do you have any other questions and there were none
in one fell swoop mr teszler had integrated the textile industry in that part of the south it was an achievement worthy of mahatma gandhi [unk] conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint
[unk] having retired from the textile industry adopted wofford college auditing courses every semester
[unk] and because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved [unk] becoming affectionately known [unk]
by all and sundry before i got there the library of the college had been named for mr teszler and after i arrived in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three
[unk] the faculty decided to honor itself by naming mr teszler professor of the college partly because at that point he had already taken all of the courses in the catalog but mainly
because he was so conspicuously wiser
than any one of us
to me it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little methodist college in upstate south carolina
was a holocaust survivor from central europe
[unk] he was indeed but he also had a wonderful sense of humor [unk] and once for an interdisciplinary class [unk] i was screening the opening segment of ingmar bergman's the seventh seal as the medieval knight antonius block returns from the wild goose chase of the crusades
and arrives on the rocky shore of sweden only to find the specter of death waiting for him
[unk] teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students and as death
opened his cloak to embrace the knight
in a ghastly embrace i heard mr teszler's tremulous voice uh oh he said
this doesn't look so good
but it was music that was his greatest passion [unk] especially opera
and on the first occasion that i visited his house he gave me honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to and i delighted
[unk] him by rejecting cavalleria rusticana in favor of bela bartok's bluebeard's castle
i love bartok's music as did mr teszler and he had virtually every recording of bartok's music
ever issued [unk] and it was at his house that i heard for the first time bartok's third piano concerto and learned from mr teszler
that it had been composed in nearby asheville north carolina in the last year of the
[unk] composer's life he was dying of leukemia and he knew it
and he dedicated this concerto to his wife dita who was herself a concert pianist and into the slow second movement [unk]
marked adagio religioso he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last
[unk] he was imagining a future
for her
in which he would play no part
and clearly clearly this composition is his final statement to her it was first performed after his death
and through her to the world and just as clearly it is saying it's okay [unk] it was all so beautiful
whenever you hear this
i will be there
it was only after
[unk] teszler's death
that i learned that the marker on the grave of bela bartok in hartsdale new york was paid for by sandor teszler
j napot [unk] bela not long before mr teszlers own death at the age of [unk] ninety seven he heard me hold forth on human
[unk] i delivered a lecture in which i described history as on the whole a tidal wave of human suffering and brutality [unk] and [unk] mr teszler came up to me afterwards
with gentle reproach and said you know doctor human beings are fundamentally good
and i made a vow to myself then and there that if this man who had such cause to think otherwise had reached that conclusion
i would not presume to differ
until he
[unk] released me from my vow and now he's dead so i'm stuck with my vow j
napot sandor i thought my skein of hungarian mentors had come to an end but almost immediately
i met francis robicsek a hungarian
doctor actually a heart surgeon in charlotte north carolina then in his late seventies who had been a pioneer in
[unk] surgery and [unk] tinkering away in his garage behind his house had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures
[unk] he's also a prodigious art collector [unk] beginning as an intern in budapest by collecting [unk]
[unk] dutch art and hungarian painting and when he came to this country moving on to spanish colonial art russian icons and finally mayan
[unk] ceramics [unk] he's the author of seven books six of them on mayan ceramics it was he who broke the mayan codex enabling scholars to relate the pictographs on mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the mayan script
on the occasion of my first visit we toured his house and we saw hundreds of works of museum quality [unk] and then we paused in front of a closed
[unk] with shelves from floor to ceiling and crammed on every shelf his collection of mayan ceramics now i know absolutely nothing about mayan ceramics but i wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so i said
[unk] alone until i let them have a piece [unk] but it was not a good one
well [unk] it occurred to me that i should invite dr robicsek to lecture at wofford college on what else [unk]
i should invite him to meet my oldest trustee who had majored in french history at yale some
[unk] largest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand his name is roger milliken

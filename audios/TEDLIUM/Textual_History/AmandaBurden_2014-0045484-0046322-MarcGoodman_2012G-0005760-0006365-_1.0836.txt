[unk] when people think about cities they tend to think of certain things they think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers noisy cabs [unk]
but when i think about cities i think about
[unk] fundamentally about people and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work [unk]
so even more important than buildings in a city
are the public spaces in between them [unk]
and today some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces [unk]
so
[unk] i believe that lively [unk] enjoyable public spaces are the key to planning a great city [unk] they are what makes it come alive [unk]
but what makes a public space work
what attracts people to successful public spaces [unk] and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away [unk]
i thought if i could answer those questions [unk] i could make a huge contribution to my city
[unk] but one of the more wonky things about me is that i am an animal behaviorist [unk]
and i use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces
one of the first spaces that i studied
was this little vest pocket park called paley park in midtown manhattan this little space became
[unk] a small phenomenon
[unk] and because it had such a profound impact on new yorkers [unk] it made an enormous impression on me
i studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather [unk] so i knew that places like paley park didn't happen
[unk] i saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail [unk]
but what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it
well i would sit in the park and watch very carefully [unk] and first among other things were the comfortable [unk] movable chairs
people would come in find their own seat [unk] move
[unk] and then stay a while [unk] and then interestingly people themselves attracted other people
and ironically [unk] i felt more peaceful if there were other people around [unk]
and it was green this little park provided what new yorkers crave [unk] comfort and greenery [unk]
but my question was why weren't there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn't feel alone
or like a trespasser [unk]
unfortunately that's not how cities were being designed
so here you see a familiar sight
this is how plazas have been designed for generations [unk] they have that stylish spartan look that we often associate
[unk] it's not surprising that people avoid spaces like this they not only look desolate [unk] they feel downright dangerous [unk]
i mean where would you sit here
what would you do here [unk]
but
architects love them they are plinths for their creations [unk] they might tolerate a sculpture
[unk] but that's about it
and for developers they are ideal there's nothing to water nothing to maintain and no undesirable people to worry about
but don't you think this is a waste
for me [unk] becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that i lived in and loved [unk]
i wanted to be able to create places that
would give you the feeling that you got in paley park and not
[unk] developers to build bleak plazas like this
but over the many years i have learned how hard it is to create successful meaningful enjoyable public spaces [unk]
as i learned from my stepfather they certainly do not happen by accident [unk]
especially in a city like new york where public space has
[unk] to be fought for to begin with and then for them to be successful somebody has to think very hard about every detail [unk]
now [unk] open spaces in cities are opportunities yes they are opportunities for commercial investment
[unk] but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city
[unk] and those two goals are often not aligned with one another [unk] and therein lies the conflict the first opportunity i had to fight
for a great public open space was in the early 1980s when i was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called battery park city in lower manhattan on the hudson river
and this sandy wasteland had lain barren for ten years and we were told unless we found a developer in six months it would go bankrupt [unk]
so we came up with a radical [unk] almost insane idea
[unk] instead of building a park as a complement to future development why don't we reverse that equation
and build a small but very high quality public open space first and see if that made a difference
[unk] so we only could afford to build a two block section of what would become a mile long esplanade
so whatever we built had to be perfect
[unk] just to make sure [unk] i insisted that we build a mock up in wood at scale of the railing and the sea wall [unk]
and when i sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me
the railing hit exactly at eye level [unk] blocking my view and ruining my experience at the water's edge [unk]
so you see
[unk] do make a difference [unk] but design is not just how something looks it's how your body feels on that seat
in that space [unk] and i believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience
in this photo [unk]
everything looks very finished [unk] but that granite edge
[unk] the back on that bench [unk] the trees in planting and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be
now this proved very valuable twenty years later
when michael bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of new york
[unk] he said to me on that very day he said that new york was projected to grow from eight to nine million people and he asked me
so where are you going to put one million additional new yorkers
well [unk] i didn't have any idea
[unk] now [unk] you know that new york does place a high value on attracting immigrants so we were excited about the prospect of growth but

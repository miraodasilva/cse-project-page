[unk] a scrambled egg [unk] but as you look at it i hope you'll begin to feel just
[unk] slightly uneasy
because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself
and you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated [unk] and now they're going to be poured back into the egg [unk] and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works
[unk] a scrambled egg is mush tasty mush but it's mush an egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things such as chickens [unk]
and we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity [unk]
in fact this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of
[unk] what that says basically
is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure
to lack of order lack of structure in fact to mush [unk] and that's why that video feels a bit strange [unk] and yet [unk]
look around us
what we see around us is staggering complexity [unk] eric beinhocker estimates that in new york city alone there are some ten billion
[unk] skus or distinct commodities being traded
that's hundreds of times as many species as there are on earth [unk]
and they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals who are linked by trade travel and the internet into a global system of stupendous complexity [unk]
[unk] a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity i've described the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center [unk]
well the answer seems to be the universe can create complexity [unk] but with great difficulty
in pockets there appear what my colleague [unk] fred spier calls
[unk] goldilocks conditions not too hot not too cold just right for the creation of complexity
and slightly more complex things appear [unk] and where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity builds stage by stage
each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost
[unk] out of nowhere in the universe [unk] we refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments [unk]
and at each threshold the going gets tougher [unk] the complex things get more fragile
more vulnerable the goldilocks conditions get more stringent [unk] and it's more difficult to create
[unk] as extremely complex creatures [unk] desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility
and that's the story that we tell in big history [unk] but to do it you have do something that may at first sight seem completely impossible you have to survey the whole history of the universe [unk]
[unk] do it
let's begin by winding the timeline back thirteen point seven billion years to the beginning of time
around us
[unk] emptiest thing you can
and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are and then suddenly
bang a universe appears an entire universe [unk] and we've crossed our first threshold the universe is tiny [unk] it's smaller than an atom [unk] it's incredibly hot [unk] it contains everything [unk]
[unk] that's in today's universe so you can imagine it's busting [unk] and it's expanding at incredible
[unk] speed
and at first it's just a blur [unk] but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur [unk]
within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity
and energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter
quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons and all of that
[unk] in the first second
now we move forward three hundred and eighty thousand years
that's twice as long as humans have been on this planet [unk] and now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium
now i want to pause for a moment three hundred and eighty thousand years after the origins of the universe
because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage
we know above all that it was extremely simple it consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure they're really a sort of cosmic mush
but that's not completely true [unk]
recent studies by satellites such as the wmap satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny differences in that background what you see here [unk]
the blue areas
are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas these are tiny differences but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity and this is how it works [unk]
gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff [unk] so where you get slightly denser areas
[unk] gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms so we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds and each cloud is compacted [unk] gravity gets more powerful [unk]
[unk] as density increases [unk] the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of ten million degrees protons start to fuse there's a huge release of
[unk] we have our first stars
from about two hundred million years after the big bang [unk] stars begin to appear all through the universe [unk] billions of them [unk]
and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex
stars will create the goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds [unk]
when very large stars die [unk] they create temperatures so high
that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations to form all the elements of the periodic table [unk] if like me you're wearing a gold ring it was forged in a supernova explosion [unk]
so now the universe is chemically more complex [unk] and in a chemically more complex universe it's possible to make more things
[unk] and what starts happening is that around young suns young stars
all these elements combine they swirl around the energy of the star stirs them around [unk] they form particles they form snowflakes they form little dust motes they form [unk]
[unk] rocks they form asteroids and eventually they form planets and moons [unk] and that is how our solar system was formed four and a half billion
[unk] rocky planets like our earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials [unk] so we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity [unk]
now
the going gets tougher [unk]
the next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile [unk] significantly more vulnerable [unk] but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity
i'm talking of course about living organisms
living organisms are created by chemistry we are huge packages of chemicals
so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales than gravity which explains why you and i are smaller than stars or planets
now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry

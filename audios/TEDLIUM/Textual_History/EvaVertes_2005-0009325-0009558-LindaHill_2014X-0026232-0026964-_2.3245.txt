[unk] a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager [unk] today i want to talk to you about the future [unk] but first i
[unk] tell you a bit about the past
my story starts way before i was born [unk] my grandmother was on a train to auschwitz the death death camp and
she was going along the tracks and the
the tracks split and somehow we don't really know exactly the whole story but the train took the wrong track and went to a
work camp rather than the death camp
[unk] my grandmother survived
and
married my grandfather they were living in hungary [unk] and my mother was born [unk] and when my mother was two years old the hungarian revolution
was raging [unk] and they decided to escape hungary [unk]
they got on a boat and yet another divergence the boat was either going to canada or to australia they got on and didn't know where they were going [unk] and ended up in
[unk] to make a long story short they came to canada my grandmother was a chemist she worked at the banting institute in toronto
[unk] and at forty four she died of stomach cancer
[unk] i never met my grandmother but i carry on her name

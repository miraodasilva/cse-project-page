Do you have a minute?
Sure, umm what would you like to discuss?
I've made a tough decision, sir. Here's my resignation.
Well, I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised. Is there any possible way to change your mind?
I'm afraid not, sir. I've made up my mind. It's something I have to do.
Can I ask why? Were you unhappy working for us?
Oh, no. not at all.
Are you planning on studying abroad?
No, sir.
Have you been given a better offer?
Oh, no. I would never look for another job while working here. I think this is a fantastic place to work.
Well, what's the problem then?

May I help you?
Yes, I'm going to Europe on business and I need to purchase some Traveller's Cheques.
That's no problem. Which currency would you like to buy?
I think Euros will be the best, as I'll only be in Mainland Europe.
Of course. Do you have your passport with you? How much would you like to purchase?
Five-thousand Euros will be sufficient, thanks.
Please fill in this form. How would you like it? In hundred Euro cheques?
